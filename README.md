# LeetCode_SlidingWindow
All the LeetCode problems that can be solved using the Sliding Window technique.
These are essentially substring problems that can be solved using this technique. It can reduce the need of using the additional for loop and thereby minimizing the time complexity

# Question Variants

- #### Fixed Length Variant
    max sum subarray of size k
- #### Dynamic Variant
    smallest sum >= some value k
- #### Dynamic Variant with Auxilary data structure
    Longest substring with no more than k distinct characters
- #### String Permutations

## How to identify the problems that could be solved using this algorithm
Everything is grouped or sub grouped sequentially   
The sub group has a condition like longest, smallest, contains, max, min
